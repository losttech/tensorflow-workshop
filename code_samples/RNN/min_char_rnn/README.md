## Implementations of min_char_rnn

This repo contain implementations of a very simple char-to-char generator, based on the blog post:  
[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks by Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). 


* min_char_rnn.py it's just a commented version with small changes of a [code](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086) from Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy), that has done this amazing work for teaching RNNs. Thank you, Andrej :)

* tensorflow_min_char_rnn.py was based on the great [code](https://gist.github.com/vinhkhuc/7ec5bf797308279dc587) from: Vinh Khuc (@knvinh), that is basically the min_char_rnn.py implemented in low-level TensorFlow. Thank you, Vinh :)

* RNNCell_min_char_rnn.py was made my @monteirom, and is the min_char_rnn.py implemented using the RNNCell from TensorFLow.
