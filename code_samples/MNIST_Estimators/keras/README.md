# Models for MNIST using Keras layers + TensorFlow Estimators

A Custom Estimator for MNIST using Keras and Estimators.
 
There are two implementations available here:
 * beginners.py is a simple logistic regression implementation,
   following https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners
 * pros.py is a CNN implementation, following https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros

For more info about Estimators API go to:
 *  https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/estimators
 
**Atention!** 
The files at *using_input_fn* and *without_input_fn* were implemented
in an older version of TensorFlow and were made in order to learn more
about TensorFlow high-level APIs.
**These files are not going to be updated and should not be used
as good implementation examples!!!**
