# Models for MNIST using TensorFlow Estimators

A Custom Estimator for MNIST using Estimators.
 
There are two implementations available here:
 * beginners.py it's a simple logistic regression implementation,
   following https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners
 * pros.py it's a CNN implementation, following https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros

In the keras/ folder there is basically the same implementation
but using keras layers instend of tf.layers!
