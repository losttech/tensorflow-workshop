# Models for MNIST using Keras layers + TensorFlow Estimators


**Atention!**  
The files at *using_input_fn* and *without_input_fn* were made in an older version
of TensorFlow and were made in order to learn more about TensorFlow high-level APIs.
**These files are not going to be updated and should not be used as good implementation examples!!!**
