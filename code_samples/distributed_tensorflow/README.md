## How to run distributed tensorflow with Estimators + Experiment

Here are structions of how to run distributed tensorflow with data parallelism
for free (**no changes in the code to get it!!!**) using estimators and experiments with **TensorFlow v.1.2 or higher**.

* In the local folder you'll find instructions about how to play with the
TF_CONFIG file locally running multiple python processes in the same machine

* In the distributed folder you'll find instructions about how to run
distributed tensorflow on basically any cloud environment including a full
tutorial of how to do it on Google Cloud.

For more info go to TensorFlow official doc:
